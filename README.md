# **I18N Dictionary Generator**

I18N Dictionary Generator is a tool designed to simplify and accelerate the process of adding and managing translations in your projects. Whether you're starting a project from scratch or integrating translations into an ongoing development, this tool helps eliminate the hassle and streamline your workflow.

## Why I Created This Tool

Adding translations partway through development can be a tedious and error-prone task. I built I18N Dictionary Generator after experiencing firsthand the challenges of retrofitting translation functionality into a project that was already underway. This tool was born out of the need for a faster, more efficient way to handle internationalization (i18n).
Features

    Automatic Key Generation: Extracts text from your project and generates structured translation keys.
    Multi-Language Support: Easily manage translations for multiple languages in a single, organized workflow.
    Customizable Output: Generate translation files in JSON, YAML, or other formats your project uses.
    Conflict Detection: Identifies duplicate or missing keys to ensure translation consistency.
    Incremental Updates: Quickly integrate new translations without redoing existing work.

Benefits

    Saves Time: Automates repetitive tasks and reduces manual effort.
    Improves Accuracy: Minimizes the risk of human errors when creating and managing translation dictionaries.
    Scales Easily: Works seamlessly with projects of any size, from small apps to large-scale platforms.
    Compatible with Your Workflow: Designed to integrate into your existing development environment and tools.
